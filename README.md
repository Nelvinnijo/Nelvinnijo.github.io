        <h2>Assembly Language</h2>
        <p>
            Assembly language is a low-level programming language used to write programs that are closely tied to the computer's hardware architecture. Each instruction in assembly corresponds directly to a machine language instruction. It is specific to a particular processor and allows direct control of hardware resources.

    <section id="machine-language">
        <h2>Machine Language</h2>
        <p>
            Machine language is the lowest level of abstraction and consists of binary numbers (0s and 1s) that the processor can execute directly. It is the native language of the processor and is extremely difficult for humans to read and write.

        <h2>Assembler</h2>
        <p>
            An assembler is a program that translates code written in assembly language into machine language. This process is called assembly. The assembler makes it easier to write complex programs in assembly, converting them into a format that the machine can execute.

        <h2>High-Level Programming Languages</h2>
        <p>
            High-level programming languages are designed to be easy for humans to read and write. They are independent of the computer's architecture and include languages like Python, Java, C++, and many others. These languages use a compiler or an interpreter to translate the source code into machine language.

        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>
            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is not a programming language but a markup language used to create and structure content on the web. HTML defines the structure of a web page using elements like paragraphs, headings, links, and images. It is a fundamental component of the World Wide Web, along with CSS and JavaScript.
